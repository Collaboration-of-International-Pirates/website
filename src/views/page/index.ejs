                <h5 class="card-title">Civil Liberties</h5>
                <p class="card-text">
                    We believe in protecting civil liberties, including freedom of conscience, freedom of press, freedom of religion, freedom of expression, and freedom of assembly. These fundamental freedoms are essential to a free and open society. However, these freedoms must be exercised responsibly and with respect for the rights of others.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    For example, freedom of expression is a fundamental human right that should be protected and upheld, but this right does not extend to hate speech or expressions of discrimination against others. It's important to distinguish between personal expressions of identity, such as gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, and religion, which should be respected and celebrated, and expressions of hate and discrimination, which have no place in our society.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    Love and respect for others should be the guiding principles when it comes to how we express ourselves, and we will work to promote an inclusive and welcoming environment for all individuals.

            <p class="card-text">We believe that everyone has inherent rights that must be respected and protected, regardless of their background or circumstances. These rights include, but are not limited to, the right to live with dignity, the right to a fair and impartial legal system, the right to equal treatment under the law, the right to privacy, and the right to access to essential services like healthcare and education. We believe that these rights are not negotiable and that they form the foundation of a just and equitable society. </p>
